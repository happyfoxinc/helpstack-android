**HelpStack** is a library to provide in-app support for your app's users, by connecting with the helpdesk of your choice. Your appâ€™s users can easily raise requests or report issues from within your app.

With HelpStack, you can:

- Let users report issues within your app, along with device & app information
- Provide self-support by showing FAQ articles
- Customise your HelpStack screen to blend with your app theme

HelpStack supports the following leading helpdesk solutions: 
- [HappyFox](https://www.happyfox.com/)
- [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/)
- [Desk.com](http://www.desk.com/)
- Email - If you don't have a helpdesk solution, you can still configure HelpStack for users to raise requests via email.

You can choose any 1 of the 4 options mentioned above, to get started with HelpStack.

Check out [helpstack.io](http://www.helpstack.io) for more information.

## Installation

Installing the HelpStack library is fairly straight-forward. 

1. Add jcenter as a repository to your app's build.gradle

        repositories {
          jcenter()
        }
        
2. Add *com.tenmiles:helpstack:1.2.0* as a dependency in the same build.gradle
        
        dependencies {
          compile 'com.tenmiles:helpstack:1.2.0'
        }

3. Add this to avoid *duplicate file during packaging APK*

        packagingOptions {
                exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
                exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
                exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
        }

## Using the Library

Broadly speaking, there are just 3 steps to begin using HelpStack within your app:

The helpdesk solutions will be referred to as **Gears**.

1. Configure HelpStack to work with the Gear of your choice.
2. Add an entry-point for HelpStack in the UI and connect it with HelpStack.
3. Customize the theme of HelpStack according to your choice.


#### Step 1 - Configure HelpStack with the Gear of your choice:

Create a custom *Application* class which extends the **Application** class. Be sure to mention it in your manifest as well.

    <application
      android:name="HSApplication"
      ...
    />    
    
Obtain the necessary credentials for the gear of your choice and create a suitable Gear object. Set the Gear object with *HSHelpStack* instance only once. 

##### Setting the Gear

The general structure of setting a gear is given below: 

    public class HSApplication extends Application {
      HSHelpStack helpStack;
      
      @Override
      public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        
        helpStack = HSHelpStack.getInstance(this); // Get the HSHelpStack instance
        
        <GearType> <gear> = new <GearType>(<Gear credentials as parameters>); // Create the Gear object 
          
        helpStack.setGear(<gear>); // Set the Gear
      }
    }
    
  Follow the instructions below for configuring the gear of your choice:
    
  - [HappyFox gear](https://github.com/happyfoxinc/helpstack-android/wiki/Configuring-gears-for-HelpStack#i-happyfox)
  - [Zendesk gear](https://github.com/happyfoxinc/helpstack-android/wiki/Configuring-gears-for-HelpStack#ii-zendesk)
  - [Desk gear](https://github.com/happyfoxinc/helpstack-android/wiki/Configuring-gears-for-HelpStack#iii-desk)
  - [Email gear](https://github.com/happyfoxinc/helpstack-android/wiki/Configuring-gears-for-HelpStack#iv-email)
                

#### Step 2 - Entry point in UI:
Add a clickable item (probably a button) in your UI, wherever appropriate. Set a *click listener* to it. Within the *click listener*, use the **showHelp** API to open up the HelpStack UI:

    HSHelpStack.getInstance(getActivity()).showHelp(getActivity());


#### Step 3 - Theming/Skinning:

It is very easy to customize the HelpStack UI, if you want it go along with your app's UI.

HelpStack comes with built-in screens and a default theme. It also comes with a set of pre-configured themes. You can download them from the link below:

#### [Download Themes](./Themes/)

Each theme comes with the following:
- A *colors.xml* and a **hs_custom_theme.xml** defined in **../values/**
- Chat bubble drawables defined in **../drawables/**.


##### Using the sample themes
- Decide which sample theme you want to use
- Include the *theme* and *colors* xml files in your application under **values**
- Include the theme's drawables under your application's **drawables**
- Now you can simply build and run the application. The HelpStack UI will use the styles specified in the chosen theme.
